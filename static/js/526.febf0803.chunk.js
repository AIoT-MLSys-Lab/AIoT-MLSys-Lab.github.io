The pervasiveness of sensor-equipped wireless connected IoT devices such as smartphones, drones, and smart home devices, combined with the power of AI , has led to a new computing paradigm, aka the \u201cArtificial Intelligence of Things\u201d (AIoT). The objective of this graduate-level seminar course is to introduce students to the building blocks of AIoT, the underlying sensing, computing, networking, and communication technologies as well as a wide range of applications that drive the AIoT revolution. In this course, you will read, present, and discuss recent research papers that cover the topics mentioned above. For some of the topics, we will also invite prominent researchers to present their research works that represent the state-of-the-arts in the areas. The overarching goals are to both gain familiarity with the fundamentals and recent advancements in AIoT as well as also to develop a deeper understanding of how to conduct high-quality research in this emerging area."]})]})]})]})}}}]);
