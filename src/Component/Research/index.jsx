              The proliferation of edge devices such as mobile phones and Internet of Things as well as the gigantic amount of data they generate make it no longer feasible to transmit all the data to the cloud for processing. Such constraint fuels the d sustainability. Achieving such goal requires a combination of approaches. My work draws insights from a broad set of disciplines including mobile & embedded systems, AI/machine learning, wireless networking, distributed systems, and human-centered computing.
