            Wearable devices are increasingly becoming mainstream consumer
products carried by millions of consumers. However, the potential
impact of these devices is currently constrained by fundamental
limitations of their built-in sensors. In this paper, we introduce radio as a new powerful sensing modality for wearable devices and
propose to transform radio into a mobile sensor of human activities
and vital signs. We present BodyScan, a wearable system that enables radio to act as a single modality capable of providing wholebody continuous sensing of the user. BodyScan overcomes key
limitations of existing wearable devices by providing a contactless
and privacy-preserving approach to capturing a rich variety of human activities and vital sign information. Our prototype design of
BodyScan is comprised of two components: one worn on the hip
and the other worn on the wrist, and is inspired by the increasingly
prevalent scenario where a user carries a smartphone while also
wearing a wristband/smartwatch. This prototype can support daily
usage with one single charge per day. Experimental results show
that in controlled settings, BodyScan can recognize a diverse set
of human activities while also estimating the userâ€™s breathing rate
with high accuracy. Even in very challenging real-world settings,
BodyScan can still infer activities with an average accuracy above
60% and monitor breathing rate information a reasonable amount
of time during each day.
